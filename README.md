# Mybnb clone website

**Live site link:**
https://airbnb-api-project-znib.onrender.com

This is a small project which is a clone of Air-bnb website, I worked on this as a proof for all my knowledge that I gained at AppAcademy.

All technologies I used in this project are:
 - Backend: JavaScript, Sequelize, Express and SQLITE
 - Frontend: HTML, CSS, React, Redux
 
**Major Feature**
- There are 3 major features right now which have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in this project:
  - User
  - Spots
  - Reviews

- First, users can signup/create their account and login with passwords already hashed and safely store in database.
- Second, users can create new spot, view their spots and other user's spot ,update their own spot, and delete their own spot.
- Third, users can create review for other user's spot, view their reivews and other user's reviews, update their reviews and delete them.

**Future features:**
 - Add and Update spot's image
 - Review images
 - User's profile page
 - Booking feature
